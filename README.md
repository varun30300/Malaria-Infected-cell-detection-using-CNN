# Malaria-Infected-cell-detection-using-CNN
This CNN model will take a cell image as an input and then it will classify as one of the two classes :- Parasatic or Uninfected

Dataset link :- https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria/downloads/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria.zip/1

Steps to use this model :-
  1 -> Download the source code and place it in a file \n
  2 -> Download the data set and unzip it in the same file as the source code \n
  3 -> Now , the file that you just unzipped contains two folder , named :-Parasitized and Uninfected. \n
  4 -> Now you change the name of the unzipped folder as train. \n
  5 -> Create a new folder and name it Test and further create two more folders within it named :-Parasitized and Uninfected. \n
  6 -> Cut 300 images from "Train/Parasitized" and paste it to "Test/Parasited". \n
  7 -> Cut 300 images from "Train/Uninfected" and paste it to "Test/Uninfected". \n
  8 -> Change the path in the model as required. \n
